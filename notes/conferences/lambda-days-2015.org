* Lambda Days 2015

** Day 1

*** Garrett Smith - Rediscovering a Useful Pattern Language, Lessons from Bouncy Squirrel

- Timeless way of building, Christopher Alexander
- Patterns are built by many, not few.
  - Architecture, building, paths.
- Pattern Language.
- Emergent Architecture.
- Patterns are created with certain emotion, this is the pattern context.
- Sample patterns - REPL, Text based representation.
  - Emotions are signals, they point to something real.
  - Discovered, not prescribed.
  - Experimental, not theoretical.

*** Kevin Hammond - Megacore, Megafast, Megacool

- Future: "manycores", "megacores" not "multicores".
  - Exascale, BIG data.
- Linking nodes into systems.
- Heterogeneous structure, NUMA.
  - NOT shared memory.
- ~34 Petaflops, 3M cores.
- Mobile phones and embedded systems as well
  - Samsung Exynos - 8 cores.
  - NVIDIA Tegra K1, 4 ARM cores, 192-core Kepler GPU
- Performance tradeoffs regarding energy usage.
- "Dark Silicon" - power cores on demand.
- Spawning 33 M threads in 4.5s of execution.
  - How to manage that?
  - 20k threads, minimize overhead of creating them.
- Building a wall - 1 worker, 4 workers
  - Not a 4x speedup - Amdahl's Law.
  - Real dependencies, accidental dependencies.
  - We need better abstractions, you shouldn't think in terms of threads.
    - No worrying on communication, dependencies, deadlocks...
    - Ill-defined parallel domains are constraining.
  - Purity means no side-effects.
  - Concurrency - illusion, execution way.
    - Programming models based on concurrency are low-level.
  - Parallelism - Hardware artifact, real.
  - Patterns of parallelism
    - Pipelines, Map-Reduce, Task farm, Divide & Conquer, parallel
      search, parallel completion...
- Erlang - *skel*.
- ParaPhrase project.
- Rephrase project.
- Dependent and Independent composition.
- Stateless computation can be redone, anywhere, anytime.
