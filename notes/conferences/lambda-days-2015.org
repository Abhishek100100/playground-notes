* Lambda Days 2015

** Day 1

*** Garrett Smith - Rediscovering a Useful Pattern Language

- Programming should be a joy for you!
- *Timeless way of building*, Christopher Alexander
- Patterns are built by many, not by few.
  - Urban architecture, city buildings, common paths.
  - Emergent Architecture.
- Pattern Language.
  - Patterns are created with certain emotion, this is the pattern context.
  - Discovered, not prescribed.
  - Experimental, not theoretical.
  - Sample patterns:
    - *REPL*, Text based representation, Pattern matching.
- Emotions are signals, they point to something real.

*** Kevin Hammond - Megacore, Megafast, Megacool

- Future: *manycores*, *megacores* not *multicores*.
  - It is happening right now: *exascale*, *big data*.
  - Linking multiple nodes into systems.
  - Heterogeneous structure.
    - Not shared memory, *NUMA*.
    - Approx. 34 petaflops, 3 millions cores.
- Not only PC - mobile and embedded systems as well e.g.:
  - Samsung Exynos - *8 cores*.
  - NVIDIA Tegra K1 - *4 ARM cores*, *192-core Kepler GPU*.
- Performance trade-offs related with energy usage.
  - *Dark Silicon*
  - Power cores on demand, if not used switch them off.
- Spawning 20k threads in 4.5s of execution.
  - *How to manage that?*
- Case study:
  - Building a wall - 1 worker, 4 workers
    - Not exactly a 4x speedup - *Amdahl's Law*.
    - Real dependencies, accidental dependencies.
- We need better abstractions, you shouldn't think in terms of threads.
  - No worrying on communication, dependencies, deadlocks...
    - Ill-defined parallel domains are constraining.
  - Purity means no side-effects.
- Models:
  - Concurrency - illusion, execution way.
    - Programming models based on concurrency are low-level.
  - Parallelism - Hardware artifact, real.
- Patterns of parallelism
  - Pipelines, Map-Reduce, Task farm, Divide & Conquer, parallel
    search, parallel completion...
  - Stateless computation can be redone, anywhere, anytime.
