* Team Management

** Observations

- Sane defaults will not work in big teams. If something will not throw an error
  people will not update it, it will be left on default value.
- Back-end developers have more trust into the 3rd party libraries than Node.js or
  front-end guys. They will add new dependency assuming that is well tested
  and maintained with best practices.
- Very nice thing is a guild responsibility.
  - Term and organization pattern gathered from Spotify.
- It is a dedicated team for certain area of project, which is collected
  by people from various teams.
- They should enforce and nurse the fragment of the project in which they're involved.
- Besides that, they're a normal developers in their teams - they should balance
  and inform colleagues about changes, improvements and monitor that all tasks
  related with their area should be done in the team as well.
