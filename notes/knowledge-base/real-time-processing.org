* Real-Time Processing

* Storm

- Real-Time batch processing without single point of failure.
- It uses `nimbus` to split and distribute the workload on the cluster.
- It uses `zookeeper` to orchestrate work and communicate between nodes.
- Not dependent from the platform.
  - You will get 100% performance on JVM.
- You can run any shell command with any kind of interpreter e.g.:
  - C++ complied executable.
  - Python scripts.
- It is based on four simple terms:
  - Stream - infinite list of tuples.
  - Spout - source of stream, producer.
  - Bolt - node with specific processing algorithm applied
    on produced data stream by spout.
  - Topology - description how to connect and shuffle,
    distribute workload between nodes.
- All elements should be implemented as a Java classes.
