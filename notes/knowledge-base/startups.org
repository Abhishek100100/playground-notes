* Start-ups

** Notes from presentations

*** Start-up School 2008, David Heinemeier Hansson

- You want to earn money - set a price!
  - If people would like to pay you, you will earn.
- Build a sustainable business.
  - And plan to build it in the long term, for 20 next years.
  - Do not plan for *do a thing and sell*.
- Solve the actual, existing and valid problem.
- Aim in the low-end, not into Top 500 Fortune companies.
- Do something better, than the others.
  - Copying is a good place to start.
- Be focused, weight your time.
  - No overtime.
- Small, iterative steps.
- Measure everything.
