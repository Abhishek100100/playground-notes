* Architecture

** Observations

- Good architecture screams out from your project from the top-level directory structure.
  - But if it will be coupled with technology it will expose not the intent.
    - Instead it will expose e.g. delivery mechanism (MVC, Web).
    - Or it will glorify the plugins, a detail (like used database).
- Good architecture maximizes number of decisions which you should not make.
- Good architecture manifests itself and communicate clearly about the intent.
- Interactors, Entities, Boundary - three important concepts in Object Oriented design.
  - They're not a replacements for MVVM, MVP, MVC.
  - They're a complementary design for the core business value structure of your application.
  - They're the definition of the domain of your problem.
