*** Survivorship Bias

The tendency to focus on survivors instead of whatever you would call
a non-survivor depending on the situation. So you are focused more on
living, successes, winners than on dead, failures and losers,
especially if the problematic part is invisible for you. Often you are
failing to see that even some kind of information is missing.

So if failures in your model are invisible for you, it is very likely
than results of your examination will be skewed into the survivors, in
this case successes.
