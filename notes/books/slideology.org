* Slide: ology: The Art and Science of Creating Great Presentations

** The End of the Presentation Neglect

- Build an emotional connection with people, do not present your own
  business.
- Types of presentations:
  - External (Clients, Press, Analytics, Community).
  - Internal (Employees, Stakeholders, Board, Investors).
- Presentation is a communication tool for these people from inside
  and outside of company.

*** Know Your Tools

- Too many words on slide.
  - Listening and Reading cannot be combined in a successful way.
  - Listening and Visuals can be successfully combined.
  - You should choose what activity should be appropriate for you
    document, and if it is more appropriate to have many words on the
    slides and reading with analysis and understanding is more
    crucial, maybe you should prepare document instead.
    - If you planned presentation, cancel it and schedule an analysis
      meeting and send aforementioned document before the meeting.
  - More than 75 words on a slide -> It is a document!
  - More than 50 words on a slide -> It is a prompter!
    - Often a way of presenting if you are not properly prepared.
  - Visuals FTW!
    - But preparing them requires bigger amount of time.
    - Simplicity! *Less is more*.
    - It should amplify the transfer, not clutter it.

** Presentation as a Ecosystem

- Three legs: Transfer, Visuals, Implementation.
  - Narration is the key! You should not only focus on the knowledge,
    but also tell a story.
- *Transfer*
  - Audience
  - Structure and Engagement
  - Scenario, Story
  - Adaptation
  - Question the authorities and *status quo*.
- *Visuals*
  - Thinking in images
  - Diagrams, Hierarchies
  - *Less is more*
  - Choose palette, backgrounds, fonts
  - Plan the dynamics, plot, flow and aims
  - Check how the eyes are flowing through the slides
  - Branding
  - Adjust visuals
- *Implementation*
  - Practice make permanent! Do it often.
  - Use paper stuff when necessary
  - Vocals, Voice and Intensity
  - Eye contacts and Gestures

** Good presentation requires attention, focus and time

- Time spent on preparations should be proportional to the stake.
  - 6-20 hours spent on researches, digging through internet and
    sources.
  - 1 hour spent on preparing audience expectations map.
  - 2 hours spent on saving ideas (ideally on small cards).
  - 1 hour spent on cleaning up and ordering the ideas.
  - 1 hour spent on critique and distilling the feedback from
    coworkers.
  - 2 hours spent on planning plot and scenario.
  - 20 - 60 hours spent on preparing slides and graphics.
  - 3 hours spent on practicing and training the presentation flow,
    voice levels, narration (trials).
- Summary: *36 - 90 hours*.

** Managing Audience Expectations

- Who they are?
  - Infer their fears, doubts.
  - Propose solutions and exact description how to avoid these
    feelings.
- Who you want to be?
  - Hero? Mentor? Fan?
  - You are for the audience, not the other way.
  - Audience is looking not for you, but for the results and knowledge
    that you can deliver.
- Audience Analysis:
  - Types of people, personalities.
  - Why they come? Benefits? Free choice or enforced?
  - Fears and Doubts.
  - Offer a *solution*. How you can help them?
  - What they should do? Offer an *exact plan*.
  - Why and how they can resist the change?
  - The most effective way of reaching them.
- Prepare personas, just before slides and graphic content
  preparation. Use it as a slide inside your presentation as a cheat
  sheet, when preparation is finished - remove it.

** Ideas and Inspirations

- Be open, in phase for ideas generation quantity is more important
  than quality.
  - Each idea is equal to the others in that phase.
  - Do not criticize.
  - Use sticky notes and markers - if you need more precision or
    place, idea can be too complicated.
  - Mind maps are structure for ideas - clusters and trees are
    sometimes more natural.
  - Open also to crazy ideas.

** Sketches

- Do not focus on quality of sketch.
  - Catch and focus the ideas, try to transfer meaning.
- Work with others when it comes to the clarity and knowledge
  transfer.
  - Visualization can be clear for you, but you should test your ideas
    with others, before you will present them to the audience.
  - When it comes to the multicultural context, you need to be simple
    and clear - e.g. RTL vs. LTR languages, signs and symbols opaque
    to the culture and country.
- After successful preparation and verification of sketches, design
  and draw slides or use the professional's work if your skills are
  not on the required level.
