* Slide: ology: The Art and Science of Creating Great Presentations

** The End of the Presentation Neglect

- Build an emotional connection with people, do not present your own
  business.
- Types of presentations:
  - External (Clients, Press, Analytics, Community).
  - Internal (Employees, Stakeholders, Board, Investors).
- Presentation is a communication tool for these people from inside
  and outside of company.

*** Know Your Tools

- Too many words on slide.
  - Listening and Reading cannot be combined in a successful way.
  - Listening and Visuals can be successfully combined.
  - You should choose what activity should be appropriate for you
    document, and if it is more appropriate to have many words on the
    slides and reading with analysis and understanding is more
    crucial, maybe you should prepare document instead.
    - If you planned presentation, cancel it and schedule an analysis
      meeting and send aforementioned document before the meeting.
  - More than 75 words on a slide -> It is a document!
  - More than 50 words on a slide -> It is a prompter!
    - Often a way of presenting if you are not properly prepared.
  - Visuals FTW!
    - But preparing them requires bigger amount of time.
    - Simplicity! *Less is more*.
    - It should amplify the transfer, not clutter it.

** Presentation as a Ecosystem

- Three legs: Transfer, Visuals, Implementation.
  - Narration is the key! You should not only focus on the knowledge,
    but also tell a story.
- *Transfer*
  - Audience
  - Structure and Engagement
  - Scenario, Story
  - Adaptation
  - Question the authorities and *status quo*.
- *Visuals*
  - Thinking in images
  - Diagrams, Hierarchies
  - *Less is more*
  - Choose palette, backgrounds, fonts
  - Plan the dynamics, plot, flow and aims
  - Check how the eyes are flowing through the slides
  - Branding
  - Adjust visuals
- *Implementation*
  - Practice make permanent! Do it often.
  - Use paper stuff when necessary
  - Vocals, Voice and Intensity
  - Eye contacts and Gestures

** Good presentation requires attention, focus and time

- Time spent on preparations should be proportional to the stake.
  - 6-20 hours spent on researches, digging through internet and
    sources.
  - 1 hour spent on preparing audience expectations map.
  - 2 hours spent on saving ideas (ideally on small cards).
  - 1 hour spent on cleaning up and ordering the ideas.
  - 1 hour spent on critique and distilling the feedback from
    coworkers.
  - 2 hours spent on planning plot and scenario.
  - 20 - 60 hours spent on preparing slides and graphics.
  - 3 hours spent on practicing and training the presentation flow,
    voice levels, narration (trials).
- Summary: *36 - 90 hours*.

** Managing Audience Expectations

- Who they are?
  - Infer their fears, doubts.
  - Propose solutions and exact description how to avoid these
    feelings.
- Who you want to be?
  - Hero? Mentor? Fan?
  - You are for the audience, not the other way.
  - Audience is looking not for you, but for the results and knowledge
    that you can deliver.
- Audience Analysis:
  - Types of people, personalities.
  - Why they come? Benefits? Free choice or enforced?
  - Fears and Doubts.
  - Offer a *solution*. How you can help them?
  - What they should do? Offer an *exact plan*.
  - Why and how they can resist the change?
  - The most effective way of reaching them.
- Prepare personas, just before slides and graphic content
  preparation. Use it as a slide inside your presentation as a cheat
  sheet, when preparation is finished - remove it.

** Ideas and Inspirations

- Be open, in phase for ideas generation quantity is more important
  than quality.
  - Each idea is equal to the others in that phase.
  - Do not criticize.
  - Use sticky notes and markers - if you need more precision or
    place, idea can be too complicated.
  - Mind maps are structure for ideas - clusters and trees are
    sometimes more natural.
  - Open also to crazy ideas.

** Sketches

- Do not focus on quality of sketch.
  - Catch and focus the ideas, try to transfer meaning.
- Work with others when it comes to the clarity and knowledge
  transfer.
  - Visualization can be clear for you, but you should test your ideas
    with others, before you will present them to the audience.
  - When it comes to the multicultural context, you need to be simple
    and clear - e.g. RTL vs. LTR languages, signs and symbols opaque
    to the culture and country.
- After successful preparation and verification of sketches, design
  and draw slides or use the professional's work if your skills are
  not on the required level.

** Diagrams

- Types:
  - Abstract - sequential, structural, sets, directional.
    - Linear, cyclic, trees, arrays, layers etc.
  - Concrete - data visualization, spatial, imagery.
    - Comparison, trends, 3D, 2D, flow, influence etc.
    - Visualizations and signs.
- *One image is worth a thousand words*.

** Data presentations

- Present meaning and conclusions, not raw data per se.
- Highlight the key information on the charts.
- Less is more - simpler design, no decorations.
- Present theme and emotions graphically instead of pure numbers.
- Do not provide redundant information e.g. table and chart.
- Stick to the unified color palette and legends.
- If legend is not necessary, put it on the chart directly.
- Use designer way of presenting statistics e.g. instead of pie chart with 100%
  put 100 dots on the slide and prepare animation between them in order to
  highlight the particular percentage or use a photo which is good for a
  corresponding topic and present raw number instead of bar chart with
  comparison.

** Designer's Way of Thinking

- You are communicating via presentation yourself and your company.
- If you are leader of fast growing, dynamic company - design should represent
  that, because it won't be reliable to the viewers.
- Take care about design. It is not important to build something pretty, but
  real and natural.
- Design studies can be helpful, but they're not necessary.

*** Place

- Contrast - it is very useful - it may be contrast by color, tone, shape,
  distance etc. It doesn't matter - often using this technique is much more
  subtle than using anything else to visualize and highlight the value of slide.
- Place - Center is more important, left and right side may symbolize
  contradictory arguments.
- Hierarchy - use it with logic, from top to bottom, from left to right, use
  shapes and sizes properly. Do not mix it!
- Arrangement.
  - Order / Disorder (*chaos*)
  - Unity / Groups
  - And other similar - use them with logic, according to the topic and theme.
- Use blank space with mind!
  - It is your normal tool, do not crowd the slides with information, split them
    into couple if they contain a lot of information.
  - Each slide should have one main focus point and at most two subsequent, less
    important points.
  - Good measure is to have *one idea, concept per slide*.
- Less is more - like a *zen garden*, simple plants, simple decorations - couple
  of stones, attention to detail. And that's it.

*** Graphics

**** Background

- Simpler, better - do not use anything which brings attention.
- Help users understand, by introducing patterns also with a background.
- Be consistent! Lightning, shading, 2D or 3D, color palette etc.
- Depth and perspective are your friend.

**** Color

- Choose them to represent you, your company and the main topic.
- Palettes:
  - Monochromatic - one slice, all colors from that slice.
  - Analogical - three slices, surrounding the main one.
  - Complementary - two slices, opposite sides of the wheel. The most
    contrast, but be careful - it can be problematic.
  - Complementary split - three slices, one of the opposite is replaced by two
    surrounding colors.
  - Triad - three slices, in equal spaces.
  - Tetrad - four slices, for each opposite colors we choose its
    surroundings - on both sides. Choose one main, and three supplementary.
- Background color:
  - Dark - formal, not for printing, do not affect the lightning in the room,
    for bigger rooms, less shadows, more glares.
  - Light - informal, enlightens the room, for smaller rooms, for printing,
    cannot add more light to the picture, it looks much cleaner.
- Half-tones are better for the background because it diminish the contrast.
- Keep in mind that your audience should take all conclusions from
  presentation, color and palettes are only the helpers. Sometimes you will
  present for color blind people, control your contrast and check if content
  is visible in the gray scale.

**** Text

- Three seconds! You should understand and grasp idea from the slide in 3
  seconds.
- Serif fonts - formal, better for reading longer text sequences, paragraphs.
- Sans serif fonts - informal, looks bigger, better for short text sequences,
  headers.
- Be consistent in your fonts - use one or two (one as a support) all the time
  in your presentation. Remember that character of the font should reflect the
  topic and your attitude.
- Less text is better - in ideal case it should contain only headers, moreover
  if you want to support your memory, use bullet points or various levels of
  headers.
- Show your text gradually or change from dimmed color to one with more
  contrast. Do not introduce animations, unless it is necessary and it will
  add more meaning.
- When using photos, take care about design and font layout on each
  slide. Communicate clearly with audience and use fonts and layout as a
  communication method. 
- Ligatures, kerning, indentation, bullet points, tracking are your friends!
- Avoid "flags" (not formatted paragraphs) and widows (words left at the end
  of sentence or paragraph).
- Bullet points should be rare! It is like bombarding your audience with data.
- Font size should be at least 28 pt. If it is less, with huge probability you
  are creating a document.
- Animations are nice to have, but not required - avoid them if they won't add
  anything valuable. Animation or video at the beginning of the presentation
  can be a nice addition, something to remember.

**** Photos and Pictures

- Build or find a library for pictures / photos which you can use without
  searching them when preparing materials.
- Avoid cliches and rubbish, and again - be consistent with the style.
- Your pictures and photos should be compliant with the rule of
  thirds. Important elements should be in the crossing points of that grid.
- You can use your own photos, if they're matching to the topic - avoid shadows,
  dust and everything that will make image processing harder.
- Lines - its style, type and character are also important and cannot be
  properly visualized on the presentation sometimes (e.g. thin, shaded lines in
  small, dark room).
- Isometric perspective will help visualize elements as those created in a one
  common ground.
- Regarding image base - look at the Cisco example, they've prepared set of
  images which was distributed on the open license, and available for everyone
  even for the competitors. Thanks to that, Cisco made a kind of industry
  standard regarding images related with networks.
- Infographics are important if you want to show a rather convoluted concept.
  - Think about steps and corresponding images, showing an idea gradually.
  - Movies can be beneficial if they are different and consistent with the
    presentation itself.

*** Dynamics and Movement

- Unnecessary animation is disturbing for your audience. Any kind of unnecessary
  animation / movements / videos / gifs are inadequate.
- If you want to use animations they have to be alive and natural. It should be
  familiar.
- Hide elements which are not described at the moment by you.
  - Audience won't read upfront what is hidden.
- Faster animations will add anxiety, excitation or surprise.
- Slower animations can introduce nostalgia.
- Creating animations think like a director.
  - Consider multiple elements like movement, direction, speed, emphasis etc.
  - E.g. movement from left to right is convenient for an eye, in opposite
    direction is harder. Moving upwards is harder, moving downwards is lighter.
- Morphing - changing shape, moving, following path etc.
- Try to spent some time on designing scenes and panorama. Try to create
  multiple slides composed into one bigger scene. You can even create more
  complicated path, if you will stick to plain background and nice, consistent
  concept.
- Animations and dynamics can simulate nice and clear metaphors.

*** Templates

- Invest your time (or your company time) into creating a template and base for
  further presentations.
- Prepare logotypes, fonts, stylistic and layout, color palettes, grids, style
  for graphical elements.
- Adjust content, flow and dynamic.
- Proper and time-proof template will be ... kind of predictable for your
  audience, they'll know what to expect, where to look etc.
- Prepare a image library as well!
- Prepare guidelines how to use a template.

*** Presentation

- Reduce amount of information on slides and notes.
  - Use photos, metaphors and *mental palace method*.
  - Focus on the key words, instead of putting whole sentences on slides.
  - Limit time and choose amount of material wisely.
- Record your trials, and listen to them in order to learn and detect failures.
- Repeat! Several times, do trials at least two weeks before presentation.
- "10/20/30" Rule - 10 slides, at most 20 minutes, at least font size 30 pt.
  - But if you will do it well, you can use 200 slides in 8 minutes.
  - You should as many as it is necessary, but every slide need to provide an
    element of your topic or story.
- Adjust your medium to the audience.
  - E.g. use props, add more text to the presentation which will be use on
    webcast etc.
- Build a relationship with an audience!

*** Manifest

- Audience is a king!
- Spread the idea and move people!
- Let them see, you are describing!
- Design, do not decorate!
- Build relations!
