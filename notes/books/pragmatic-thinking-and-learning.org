* Introduction

Software is created in your head.
My comment: so try to not put rubbish into it.

** Wetware

wetware - (etymology) *wet* + *software*; humorous analogy to the
software and hardware, but applied to the biological areas. It is
a reference to the water found in living creatures.

** Context

Context is the most important thing when learning, talking, applying
newly learned stuff. In other words context is a 'king' and should
taken into consideration always.

The key information about context is related with the paths in the
brains activated by certain actions - typing notes on the computer
and in the notebook with pen and paper have the same output. 
However the way and creative process is very different between 
these two approaches.
